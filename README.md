# Popular Attraction/Landmark Recognition Using Google Landmark Dataset

With a rapid increase in the use of smartphones and other social apps, Image Recognition, Image Classification and Image Processing are the latest concepts that interest data engineers in computer
vision tasks. A major challenge with image classification is the lack of a large, annotated dataset to train better and robust models. 

## Problem Statement

Recognizing and training the model to identify any landmark is a challenging task as the appearance of the landmark varies with geometry, illumination and a different aspect ratio of the
image presented. To overcome this issue, a collection of images is used to capture typical appearance of the location. This project will focus to build a model that recognizes a given popular attraction or landmark using Google landmark dataset. This landmark recognition model will be
handy to identify the name of a landmark in the image. This will also helpful for photo organization in smartphones and fields like aviation, maps, crime - solving, etc.
